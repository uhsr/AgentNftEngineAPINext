# AgentNftEngineAPINext

## Description

This repository houses a Solidity-based NFT contract leveraging Merkle tree proofs for efficient whitelisting and gas-optimized minting, incorporating a dynamic SVG rendering engine for on-chain visual metadata generation.

## Features

- Integrate a GraphQL API endpoint for efficient NFT metadata querying.
- Implement a caching layer using Redis to reduce database load during high-volume NFT lookups.
- Develop a robust rate-limiting mechanism based on IP address and API key to prevent abuse.
- Utilize WebSockets for real-time event streaming of NFT minting, transfers, and sales.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using JWT tokens for secure API endpoint authorization.
- Provide detailed API usage metrics and logging using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
- Support batch processing of NFT metadata updates through a dedicated asynchronous queue system.
- Enable dynamic scaling of API instances using Kubernetes to handle fluctuating traffic demands.
